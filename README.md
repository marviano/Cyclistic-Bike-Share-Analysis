# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
## 1st Case Study of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
#### Austin Sebastian Marviano - 18/February/2022

### :clapper: Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

### :question: Business Task
1. The goals to strategize converting casual riders into annual members
2. Understand how annual members and casual riders differ
3. Analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends
4. Design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members

# [Link to Datasets](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

It's size are >25 MB so i can't upload it here<br />
Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study,
the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this license.

Data used : 
- 2021, Month of 01-11
- 2022, Month of 01

Changes made :
1. Mixing the 2021 and 2022 due to too many invalid data on 2021 month of 06-10, at the "started at" & "ended at" column's rows filled with "######". 
2. Cleaning and Aggregate all of each month files into one file named "202102-202201_divvy-tripdata.csv"
3. Added "ride_length" & "day_of_week" columns using "Google Spreadsheet'




```
# Storing data to data frame
master_trip<- read.csv("202102-202201_divvy-tripdata.csv")


# Checking the columns and structure
colnames(master_trip)
str(master_trip)

# Making sure the categories & members are unique
ride_ctg <- unique(master_trip$rideable_type)
member_cat <- unique(master_trip$member_casual)
ride_ctg
member_cat
table(master_trip$rideable_type)
table(master_trip$member_casual)
```

### Adding date, day, month, year, day of week column
```
master_trip$date <- as.Date(master_trip$started_at) 
master_trip$day <- format(as.Date(master_trip$started_at), "%d") 
master_trip$month <- format(as.Date(master_trip$started_at), "%m")
master_trip$year <- format(as.Date(master_trip$started_at), "%Y") 
master_trip$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(master_trip$started_at), "%A") 
```

### Adding ride length in minutes column
```
master_trip$ride_length_mins <- difftime(master_trip$ended_at, master_trip$started_at, units = "mins")
master_trip$ride_length_mins <- as.numeric(as.character(master_trip$ride_length_mins))
```

### Bad Data Removal
Keeping the old data frame and creating a new data frame filled with cleaned data
```
master_trip_2 <- master_trip[!(master_trip$ride_length<=0),]
sum(master_trip$ride_length<=0)
sum(master_trip_2$ride_length<=0)
sum(master_trip$ride_length>=1440)
master_trip_2 <- master_trip_2[!(master_trip_2$ride_length>=1440),]
sum(master_trip_2$ride_length>=1440)
```
Summary : 
- <= 0 mins ride_length removed, 1
- more than 1 day ride_length removed, 2
 

###  Dataframe columns of master_trip_2, for visualization
```
[1] "ride_id"            "rideable_type"      "started_at"         "ended_at"           "start_station_name"
[6] "start_station_id"   "end_station_name"   "end_station_id"     "start_lat"          "start_lng"         
[11] "end_lat"            "end_lng"            "member_casual"      "ride_length"        "day_of_week"       
[16] "X"                  "X.1"                "X.2"                "date"               "day"               
[21] "month"              "year"               "ride_length_mins"  
```

### Descriptive Stastistics, all members type are included
```
mean(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins) 
median(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins) 
min(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins) 
max(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins) 
```
Result : 
1. Mean : 19.44
2. Median : 11.95
3. Min : 0.01
4. Max : 1439.95


### Comparison of each member type ride length
```
# Mean - Casual : 26.84 | Member : 13.36
aggregate(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins~ master_trip_2$member_casual, FUN = mean)

# Median - Casual : 15.93 | Member : 9.55
aggregate(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins~ master_trip_2$member_casual, FUN = median)

# Min - Casual : 0.01 | Member : 0.01
aggregate(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins~ master_trip_2$member_casual, FUN = min)

# Max - Casual : 1439.91 | Member : 1439.95
aggregate(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins~ master_trip_2$member_casual, FUN = max)
```

### Converting day_of_week from number to day
```
master_trip_2$day_of_week <- ordered(master_trip_2$day_of_week, levels 
= c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"))
```

### Average ride length in minutes each day
```
aggregate(master_trip_2$ride_length_mins ~ master_trip_2$member_casual + master_trip_2$day_of_week, FUN =mean)
```
```

# Findings
1. Saturday and Sunday is always be dominated by casual member, it's twice than the member type users, outside that is dominated by member type user. 
2. No members are using the docked bike, it's only popular on casual member. But it's still the least popular than the other bike type
3. Docked bike is the least popular among the user
4. Casual users ride the longest average duration
5. The amount of casual members are almost half of the entire user count, it's occupied 40% of the total user population

# Summary / Suggestions
1. The company can make a promotion/marketing strategy focused on Saturday and Sunday for effective and efficient on converting the casual to member user
2. Create a duration based promotion milestone and Weekend promotion on the membership program

# Future Improvement
1. Too many missing station name is missing
	Adding auto completion of station name by comparing it with the langitude and longitude.
2. There are 652 of ride length under/equal than 0 minutes
	Adding validation upon the input should do the job to lessen the data error
3. There are 4067 of ride lgnth more/equal than 1 day
	Giving reminder or limitation of 1 day rent, and then giving an overcharge fee for more than a 1 day rent will lessen the more than 1 day bike rent
